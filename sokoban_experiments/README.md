# Experiments playing Sokoban with Deep Reinforcement Learning

This repo is a bunch of experiments for an independent study. Eventually, this will turn into 
an app to learn and play an OpenAI Gym implementation of Sokoban. 

Things to try out:
* Use a tree search method and train a DNN to learn the heuristic for Sokoban. Could use existing heuristics/algorithms for imitation learning.
* Try Q-map method:  [Scaling All-Goals updates in Reinforcement Learning using CNNs](http://kormushev.com/papers/Pardo_AAAI-2020.pdf) 

Gym Environments:
* [gym-sokoban (for level playing)](https://github.com/mpSchrader/gym-sokoban)
* [gym-pcgrl (for level generation)](https://github.com/amidos2006/gym-pcgrl)
